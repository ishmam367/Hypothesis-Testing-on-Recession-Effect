# Hypothesis-Testing-on-Recession-Effect
The objective of the project is to test the Hypothesis that if the mean housing prices in university towns in USA were less affected due to recession than other towns. 
Here I have combined 3 different files and merged them to find that out .

Coclusion: By doing a T-Test we reject the null hypothesis as our p value is 0.0043252148535112009,which is less than  0.01. So we can conclude that the mean housing prices of University Towns in the United States were less affected by the recession
